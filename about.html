    <p>Dear Sir/ Madam</p>
    <p>
      I literally took close to an hour perfecting this page just for you to see
      it
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to impress you with my knowldge and skills. It may be common
      knowledge to you to see a website
    </p>
    <p>But I would like you to keep in mind that coding isnt for everybody</p>
    <p>
      I actually enjoy it because it involves problem solving. I am not good in
      mathh honestly but I have my way with figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of this letter to you is that I am interested in joining the
      your IT development team
    </p>
    <p>
      I belive to carry with me external insight that could benefit the both of
      us
    </p>
    <p>
      I am being open with you and I hope to recieve the same energy from you.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      I may not know you but I am willing to know you with the chance that you
      can help me and I you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But dear partner I am in a crisis of some serious financial strain allow
      me to work for you for some incentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not ask for much my problems may not be as big as yours but I
      certainly want to earn enough to get by on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not want to live based on survival alone I want to live as
      comfortable as possible too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promise to use my knowledge and skills to your benefit as you see fit
      and to connect/ support with my soon to colleages in exchange for a
      monthly payment of least P4000.00
    </p>
    <p>
      I got bills to pay and mouths to feed, a dream to archieve and that amount
      may be a good starting point for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to hear from you soon with the intent of being called for an
      interview but dont expect a super smart boy walking into your office.
    </p>
    <p>
      I encourage you to keep an open mind, I am but just a simple honest man
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Thank your for your time reading this</p>

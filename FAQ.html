        <br>
        <h3>Account heat levels</h3>
        <p>Your heat level is your risk taking meter it will be used to waiver you been trustworthy or not</p>
        <p>A heat level is a scale that measures your honesty and safe usage with our portal the lower the heat level the better</p>
        <p>When you login into your account for the first time it's heat level is by default set to 4.9 reason behind that is that you havent earned our trust badge yet</p>
        <p>Account heat levels amount to a maximum of 10 but each account recieves 1 warning messages before increasing their account heat level before performing a risky task.</p>
        <p>A heat level is not limited to the standard scaling up of number it can bounce from 0 to 10 in an instant depending on the critial case reported so use it wisely</p>
        <p>An account with a heat level 5 and above are deemed as critical and thus could possibly face a loss of data and borrowed periphelas/ services</p>
        <p>A heat level can be decreased by depositing money into our trustfund which will be used to help other developers within the forum in their times of need.</p>
        <p>Heat drops purchases between 0.5 - 1.5 will often charge at the price range of P50.00 to P100.00, Heat drops purchases more than 3 - 6 will often charge at the price range of P1,000.00 - P10,000.00</p>
        <br>
        <p>Heat drop purchases higher than 3.9 will clear your heat down to 0</p>
        <p>Not saying it is impossible to be at heat level 0 if your record on our servers show a bad history you may be suspended temporarily from using our service for 14 days.</p>
        <p>Our AI will enable your account after scanning your documents and has verified their authenticity if not your account will get closed and your funds will be returned to you within 30 days</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Account ban, freeze or termination</h3>
        <p>Any sign of miscellaneous, weird, untrustworthy, criminal or illegal activies on our portal will lead to your account being closed either temporarily or permanently</p>
        <p>Our website uses artificial intelligence to remotely look over your account activity and will report bad usage if detected or you have been reported</p>
        <p>The trained AI was trained to learn a user's engagement with various or a series of events that would help us better protect your account from criminals</p>
        <p>You will lose access to your account in 30mins when it reaches account heat level 8.7</p>
        <p>In an event that your account faces such a fate we may request for additional personal information to be used to verify, or match against your previous actions to help us know if you will be allowed back into our portal or not.</p>
        <p>But that occuring doesnt guarantee that we will reduce your heat level.</p>
        <p>Time is a healing factor so dont worry if your heat level doesnt drop after a few days or months it will go down but it will only go down to as low as your account activity</p>
        <p>Inactive accounts in most cases could have close to a range of 0 - 0.5 heat levels and will be frozen until the user returns.</p>
        <p>Active accounts with 0 heat levels will be represented by an online status/ badge of trust</p>
        <br>
        <p>Trust badges are earned and cannot be bought, You can earn a trust badge if you have reach account heat level 1.5 and is active, it may sound easy to earn it but easy as it comes easy as it goes</p>
        <p>Meaning to say you will lose your trust badge when you reach heat level 5.1</p>
